# Code Review Process

## 1. Initiation

- **Request for Review**: The developer who has completed a task or feature requests a code review.

## 2. Assignment

- **Selecting Reviewers**: Team leads or project managers assign one or more reviewers to assess the code.

## 3. Review

- **Review the Code**: Reviewers thoroughly examine the code for issues such as bugs, style violations, and adherence to coding standards.
- **Documentation**: Reviewers may require proper documentation and comments for the code.
- **Testing**: Ensure that the code is tested and meets the specified requirements.
- **Security**: Verify that security best practices are followed.
- **Performance**: Check for potential performance bottlenecks.

## 4. Feedback

- **Comments and Suggestions**: Reviewers provide feedback, comments, and suggestions for improvement.
- **Discussion**: Developers and reviewers may engage in discussions to resolve issues.

## 5. Iteration

- **Code Changes**: The developer makes necessary changes based on feedback.
- **Re-review**: The code is re-submitted for review if major changes were made.

## 6. Approval

- **Acceptance**: Once the code meets the requirements and receives approval from reviewers, it's marked for acceptance.

## 7. Merging

- **Merging**: The code is merged into the main branch or repository.

## 8. Documentation

- **Record Keeping**: Keep records of the code review for future reference.

## 9. Continuous Improvement

- **Feedback Loop**: Use feedback from code reviews to improve development practices and coding standards.

This process helps maintain code quality, find and fix issues early, and foster collaboration within development teams. The specifics may vary from one organization to another, but the fundamental principles remain consistent.
